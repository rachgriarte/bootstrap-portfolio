			<p> Rachel Griarte is known for always having passion for fashion. When she was just four years old, her mother would dress her but she would go back to her closet to try and add more pieces to her clothing. As she grew older, Rachel fell in love with styling clothes, reading magazines on fashion, and watching beauty gurus on YouTube. </p>
			<p>In October of 2016, Rachel stayed with her sister, Charm, in Lower East, Manhattan, New York to learn the culture, fashion, and much more. She realized that she wanted to make more than what a typical low minimum-wage employees make that she decided to go back to school. Rachel is now attending a 6 month program as of recently.</p>
